### <a name="Description">Description:</a>
This project serves as a homework assignment submission for the sixth week of UT's web dev coding bootcamp.  It contains a codebase and a deployed webpage for a weather dashboard web app.

### <a name="Notes">Notes from Dan:  </a>

I mostly enjoyed completing this assignment.  I learned a lot about AJAX and jQuery that we did not cover in our class sessions, such as how to use .then() and .catch() to work within the asynchronous nature of AJAX.  Most of the issues I had with this project were related to handling edge cases.  

I have a number of additional features that I would like to add at a later point, including buttons to remove individual cities from the search history, more sophisticated CSS styling, and an autocomplete feature for the search query using the Google places API.  

### <a name="Credits">Credits: </a>
This project was completed by Dan Aument using code and assets provided by The Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin in partnership with Trilogy Education Services. I adapted some code from https://flaviocopes.com/how-to-uppercase-first-letter-javascript/ to ~text-transform: capitalize~ my search input string in JavaScript.
